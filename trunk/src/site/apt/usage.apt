API usage

  The API usage is very simple. Instantiate a <<<HolidayManager>>> by calling <<<getInstance()>>> for one
  country or one URL to a holiday xml file and use this manager to determine the holidays for a year/state/district.
  
Code Example

 [[3]] To get a <<<HolidayManager>>> instance for US holidays:
  
-----------------------
HolidayManager m = HolidayManager.getInstance(HolidayCalendar.UNITED_STATES);

or

URL url = new URL("file:some/path/MyHolidays.xml");
HolidayManager m = HolidayManager.getInstance(url);

-----------------------

 [[3]] To get the holidays for the state New York:
 
-----------------------
  Set<Holiday> holidays = m.getHolidays(2010, "ny");
----------------------- 
  
 [[3]] To get the holidays for New York City in the state New York:

-----------------------
  Set<Holiday> holidays = m.getHolidays(2010, "ny", "nyc");
-----------------------
  
 [[4]] To get a <<<HolidayManager>>> instance for your own holidays:
   
   [[a]] create a Holidays file i.e. <<<Holidays_MyOwn.xml>>>
  
   [[b]] put your holiday rules into this (for examples please the XML files in the provided JAR file in the folder holidays)
  
   [[c.1]] put your <<<Holidays_MyOwn.xml>>> in your applications classpath
   
   [[c.2]] put your <<<Holidays_MyOwn.xml>>> somewhere and reference it by URL
  
   [[d.1]] to use your holiday rules create an <<<HolidayManager>>> instance by calling <<<HolidayManager m = HolidayManager.getInstance("MyOwn");>>>
  
   [[d.2]] to use your holiday rules create an <<<HolidayManager>>> instance by calling <<<HolidayManager m = HolidayManager.getInstance(url);>>>

   [[e]] call <<<Set<Holiday> holidays = m.getHolidays(2010);>>> to retrieve the holidays for 2010.
